      <h4 class="tighten">October 2019</h4>
      <p>Convenience augments homeless students’ educational outcomes. Homeless K–8 graders whose families are placed in shelters near their schools have 8 percent (2.4 days) better attendance, are a third (18 percentage points) less likely to change schools, and exhibit higher rates of proficiency and retention. Homeless high schoolers have 5 percent (2.5 days) better attendance, 29 percent (10 pp) lower mobility, and 8 percent (1.6 pp) greater retention when placed locally. These results proceed from novel administrative data on homeless families observed in the context of a scarcity-induced natural experiment in New York City. A complementary instrumental variable strategy exploiting homeless eligibility policy reveals a subset of proximity-elastic students benefit considerably more. Panel evidence demonstrates homelessness does not cause educational impairment as much as reflect large preexisting deficits.</p>

        <h4 class="extra-top-space">2019</h4>
        <p>Using an original administrative panel and exploiting a scarcity-induced natural experiment, I investigate the effects of New York City’s neighborhood-based shelter placement policy on homeless families. The outcomes I consider encompass shelter use, public benefit receipt, and employment. Complementary instrumental variable and regression discontinuity designs exploiting policy shocks and rules, respectively, assess heterogeneous impacts among difficult-to-place families. A family fixed effects model capitalizing on multi-spell counterfactuals delivers a third identification strategy. My results, which will be released pending agency review, yield behavioral insights that can be applied to the design of poverty alleviation programs more generally.</p>
